## VI-DAS Car Events HUD
This repository holds the code for a simple car events display.

## How to run the app
To run the app you should have installed NodeJS on your laptop (at least version 8+). Run this command to start the app:
```
$ npm start
```

The application starts on port `3000`. To test the event detection, open a browser tab and point it at http://localhost:3000 and then in the other tab go to http://localhost:3000/events 
The first tab should show the event icon flashing for 3 seconds. If you look away you might miss it!
